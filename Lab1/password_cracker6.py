#To further improve security, password files usually do not contain the hash of the password PWx of user x. 
# Instead, the password file contains two values for each user x: a random value saltx , called salt, and the 
# result of hashing of a combination of the password PWÂ¬x and of the salt. In this question, you are given a file 
# SaltedPWs which contains, for each user x, the pair (saltx , h(PWx+saltx)), where saltx is a random value chosen for user x.
# Write a new program, Break6.py, that uses the file SaltedPWs to find the passwords of as many gang members as 
# possible that use passwords from PwnedPWs100K concatenated with two random digits, as quickly as possible. 
# Break6 should also save a file containing the names and corresponding passwords. Confirm the exposures using Login.pyc.
