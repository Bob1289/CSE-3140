# Look in the Q5files subdirectory and you will find the 
# R5.py and encrypted content files. Your goal is, again, 
# to write a decryption program, D5.py. As in question 4, 
# you are lucky to have the code of R5.py, and even more 
# lucky in that this ransomware turns out, again, to use 
# a symmetric (shared key) cryptosystem. 

# However, your task is a bit more challenging, 
# since the new ransomware, R5.py, is obfuscated, 
# namely, written intentionally in a way designed to make 
# it harder to understand the program â€“ and to find the key, 
# as required to decrypt the file. Obfuscation is an 
# interesting and challenging subject, and used quite a lot 
# in cybersecurity; in this question, the obfuscation is quite weak, 
# so it should not be too hard to break, and write a new decryption program, D5.py.
# R5.py can be found in this directory

# Use R5.py to write a decryption program, D5.py, 
# that can decrypt the encrypted files in the Q5files subdirectory.
# You are not given the key, only the program, R5.py, which is used to encrypt the files.
